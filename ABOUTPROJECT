Project Plan: Motion Sensor Triggering a Camera Using Verilog on FPGA
As our home automation project, we will make a camera that is triggered by a motion sensor and takes a photo in order to the signal recieved.
You can use this home automation device for security purposes at home entrance doors, to detect people entering a room or a place, or to find out who ate the snacks in your snack stash.
To implement your motion-triggered camera project using Verilog, we need to understand how Verilog allows us to control hardware components such as the PIR motion sensor and camera module. Since Verilog is primarily a hardware description language (HDL) used to design digital circuits, we can create logic to handle motion detection and trigger the camera module. But Verilog does not interface directly with cameras, so we will need additional hardware (such as an FPGA or MCU) to control external components so we plan to concantrate on learning ways to do that while improving ourselves at Verilog.
